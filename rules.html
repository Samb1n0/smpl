        <h2>Powerlifts and the Rules of Performance</h2>

        <div class='rules' id='showsquatrules'>Squat Rules</div>
            <div id="squatrules" class='hidden'>
<p>                
1) The lifter shall face the front of the platform. The bar shall be held horizontally across the shoulders, hands and fingers gripping the bar. The hands may be positioned anywhere on the bar inside and or in contact with the inner collars
<br><br>
2) After removing the bar from the racks, (the lifter may be aided in removal of the bar from the racks by the spotter / loaders) the lifter must move backwards to establish the starting position. When the lifter is motionless, erect (slight deviation is allowable) with knees locked the Chief Referee will give the signal to begin the lift. The signal shall consist of a downward movement of the arm and the audible command “Squat”. Before receiving the signal to “squat” the lifter may make any position adjustments within the rules, without penalty. For reasons of safety the lifter will be requested to “Replace” the bar, together with a backward movement of the arm, if after a period of five seconds he is not in the correct position to begin the lift. The Chief Referee will then convey the reason why the signal was not given
<br><br>
3) Upon receiving the Chief Referee’s signal the lifter must bend the knees and lower the body until the top surface of the legs at the hip joint is lower than the top of the knees. Only one decent attempt is allowed. The attempt is deemed to have commenced when the lifters knees have unlocked
<br><br> 
4) The lifter must recover at will to an upright position with the knees locked. Double bouncing at the bottom of the squat attempt or any downward movement is not permitted. When the lifter is motionless (in the apparent final position) the Chief Referee will give the signal to rack the bar
<br><br> 
5) The signal to rack the bar will consist of a backward motion of the arm and the audible command “Rack”. The lifter must then return the bar to the racks. Foot movement after the rack signal will not be cause for failure. For reasons of safety the lifter may request the aid of the spotter / loaders in returning the bar to, and replacing it in the racks. The lifter must stay with the bar during this process
<br><br> 
6) Not more than five and not less than two spotter / loaders shall be on the platform at any time. The Referees may decide to the number of spotter / loaders required on the platform at any time 2, 3, 4, or 5
                
<br>                
<h3>Causes for Disqualification of a Squat</h3>

6) Contact with the bar or the lifter by the spotter / loaders between the Chief Referee’s signals in order to make the lift easier
<br><br>  
7) Contact of the elbows or upper arms with the legs. Slight contact is permitted if there is no supporting that might aid the lifter
<br><br>

	<div id="benchrules" class="hidden">
<p>
1) The bench shall be placed on the platform with the head facing the front or angled up to 45 degrees
<br><br>  
2) The lifter must lie on his back with head, shoulders and buttocks in contact with the bench surface. The feet must be flat on the floor (as flat as the shape of the shoe will allow). His hands and fingers must grip the bar positioned in the rack stands with a thumbs around grip. This position shall be maintained throughout the lift. Foot movement is permissible but must remain flat on the platform. The hair must not hide the back of the head when lying down on the bench. Pony tail is preferred
<br><br>  
3) To achieve firm footing the lifter may use flat surfaced plates, or blocks not exceeding 30 cm in total height and a minimum dimension of 60 cm x 40 cm, to build up the surface of the platform. Blocks in the range of 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm, should be made available for foot placement at all international competitions
<br><br>  
4) Not more than five and not less than two spotter / loaders shall be on the platform at any time.

The lift off if assisted by the spotter / loaders must be at arms length
<br><br>  
5) The spacing of the hands shall not exceed 81 cm measured between the forefingers (both forefingers must be within the 81 cm marks and the whole of the forefingers must be in contact with the 81 cm marks if maximum grip is used). The use of the reverse grip is forbidden
<br><br>  
6) After removing the bar from the racks, with or without the help of the spotter / loaders, the lifter shall wait with straight arms elbows locked for the Chief Referee’s signal. The signal shall be given as soon as the lifter is motionless and the bar properly positioned. For reasons of safety the lifter will be requested to “Re-place” the bar, together with a backward movement of the arm, if after a period of five seconds he is not in the correct position to begin the lift. The Chief Referee will then convey the reason why the signal was not given.

<br><br>  
8) After receiving the signal, the lifter must lower the bar to the chest or abdominal area (the bar shall not touch the belt), hold it motionless, after which the Chief referee will signal the audible command “Press”. The lifter must then return the bar to straight arms length elbows locked. When held motionless in this position the audible command “Rack” shall be given together with a backward motion of the arm

without the device, with compensatory weight added according to the established fraction chart. Refer to WEIGHING IN item 5. For lifters with dysfunctional lower limbs that require leg braces or similar devices for walking, the deviceshall be considered as part of the natural limb and the lifter shall be weighed in wearing the device
        
        <h3>Causes for Disqualification of a Bench Press</h3>

<p>
1. The lifter shall face the front of the platform with the bar laid horizontally in front of the lifters feet, gripped with an optional grip in both hands and lifted until the lifter is standing erect
<br><br>  
2. On completion of the lift the knees shall be locked in a straight position and the shoulders back
<br><br>  
3. The Chief Referee’s signal shall consist of a downward movement of the arm and the audible command “Down”. The signal will not be given until the bar is held motionless and the lifter is in the apparent finished position
<br><br>  
4. Any rising of the bar or any deliberate attempt to do so will count as an attempt. Once the attempt has begun no downward movement is allowed until the lifter reaches the erect position with the knees locked. If the bar settles as the shoulders come back (slightly downward on completion) this should not 
be reason to disqualify the lift
<br>
        <h3>Causes for Disqualification of a Deadlift</h3>
 
1. Any downward movement of the bar before it reaches the final position

<p>
    1. Weighing in of the competitors must take place no earlier than two hours before the start of the 
competition for a particular category / categories. All lifters in the category / categories must attend the 
weigh in, which will be carried out in the presence of two / three appointed referees. Weight categories 
may be combined in a single lifting session
<br><br> 
2. If not already done, lots will be drawn to establish the order of weigh in. The lots drawn also establish 
the order of lifting throughout the competition when lifters require the same weights for their attempts
<br><br> 
3. The weigh in period will last one and a half hours
<br><br> 
4. The weigh in for each competitor will be carried out in a room with the door closed, with only the 
competitor, his coach or manager and the two/three referees present. For reason of hygiene the lifter 
should wear socks / paper towel on scales platform.
<br><br> 
5. Lifters may be weighed nude or in underwear which complies with the specifications set out in the 
appropriate section of the rule book and which does not effectively change the lifter’s weight. If a 
question exists regarding weight of undergarments, a re-weigh in the nude may be requested. In 
competitions in which women are competitors, the weigh in procedure may be altered to ensure that 
lifters are weighed by officials of their own sex. Additional female officials (not necessarily referees)
may be appointed for this purpose. Disabled/Amputee lifters who are competing in bench press
championships will have the following additions to their bodyweight :<br>
For each below ankle amputation = 1/54 of bodyweight<br>
For each below knee amputation = 1/36 of bodyweight<br>
For each above knee amputation = 1/18 of bodyweight<br>
For each hip disarticulation = 1/9 of bodyweight<br>
For lifters with dysfunctional lower limbs that require leg braces or similar devices for walking, the
device shall be considered as part of the natural limb and the lifter shall be weighed in wearing the
device
<br><br> 
6. Each lifter may only be weighed once. Only those whose bodyweight is heavier or lighter than the 
category limits of the category entered are allowed to return to the scales. They must return to the scales
and make weight within the limits of the hour and a half allowed for the weigh in; otherwise they will 
be eliminated from the competition. A lifter can only be re-weighed as often as time and orderly 
progression by lots allows. A lifter may only be weighed outside the time limit of one and a half hours 
if he presents himself within the time limit, but due to the number of lifters trying to make weight, he is 
denied the opportunity of mounting the scales. He may then be allowed one re-weigh at the discretion 
of the referees. The lifter’s agreed bodyweight must not be made public until all lifters competing in the 
particular category / categories have been weighed in
<br><br> 
7. A lifter may only weigh in the category in which he was nominated 21 days prior to the meet date.
In the case where groups are formed in a particular weight class the B & C groups may lift at a separate 
and earlier time to the A group. Where groups lift at separate times in this way the A group must have a 
minimum of 8 (eight) and a maximum of 12 (twelve) lifters
<br><br> 
8. Lifters should check squat and bench press rack heights and foot blocks prior to the start of the
competition. The rack height sheet must be signed or initialed after the check by the lifter or coach. It is 
in their interest. A copy of this official document goes to the Jury, Speaker, and Platform Manager.
